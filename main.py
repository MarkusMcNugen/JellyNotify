Jellynouncer Discord Webhook Service

This module provides a comprehensive intermediate webhook service that sits between Jellyfin
media server and Discord, enabling intelligent notifications for new media additions and
quality upgrades.

Architecture Overview:
    The service follows a modular, async-first design with clear separation of concerns:

    1. Configuration Layer (Pydantic Models):
       - Type-safe configuration with validation using Pydantic v2
       - Environment variable overrides for Docker deployments
       - Nested configuration structures for organized settings

    2. Data Layer (DatabaseManager):
       - SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent access (multiple readers, single writer)
       - Content hashing for change detection to avoid duplicate notifications
       - Batch operations for performance during library syncs

    3. Integration Layer (JellyfinAPI, DiscordNotifier):
       - Jellyfin API client with retry logic for network resilience
       - Discord webhook with rate limiting to respect Discord's API limits
       - Template-based message formatting using Jinja2 templates

    4. Logic Layer (ChangeDetector, WebhookService):
       - Intelligent change detection (resolution upgrades, codec improvements, audio enhancements, HDR)
       - Webhook routing based on content type (movies vs TV shows vs music)
       - Background sync and maintenance tasks using asyncio

    5. API Layer (FastAPI):
       - RESTful endpoints for webhook processing from Jellyfin
       - Health checks and diagnostics for monitoring
       - Debug endpoints for troubleshooting and development

Key Features:
    - Smart change detection (new vs. upgraded content)
    - Multi-webhook routing (separate channels for movies, TV, music)
    - Rate limiting and error recovery to handle network issues
    - Background library synchronization to catch missed webhooks
    - Template-based Discord embeds for rich media information
    - Comprehensive logging and monitoring for production deployment

Example Usage:
    This service is designed to run as a Docker container with environment variables
    for configuration:

    ```bash
    # Set required environment variables
    export JELLYFIN_SERVER_URL="http://jellyfin:8096"
    export JELLYFIN_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    export JELLYFIN_USER_ID="your_user_id_here"
    export DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."

    # Run the service
    python main.py
    ```

Dependencies:
    - FastAPI: Modern async web framework for the API layer
    - aiohttp: Async HTTP client for Discord webhooks and external API calls
    - aiosqlite: Async SQLite database operations to avoid blocking the event loop
    - Pydantic: Data validation and configuration management with Python type hints
    - Jinja2: Template engine for Discord embed formatting
    - jellyfin-apiclient-python: Official Jellyfin API client

    Async context manager for FastAPI application lifespan management.

    This function handles the complete lifecycle of the Jellynouncer application,
    including startup initialization and graceful shutdown procedures. It uses
    Python's async context manager pattern to ensure proper resource management.

    The lifespan pattern is the modern FastAPI way to handle startup/shutdown,
    replacing the deprecated @app.on_event("startup") decorators.

    Args:
        app: The FastAPI application instance

    Yields:
        None: Control is yielded back to FastAPI to handle requests

    Raises:
        SystemExit: If critical initialization fails, the application will exit

        ```

    Note:
        All code before the `yield` statement runs during application startup.
        All code after the `yield` statement runs during application shutdown.
        This ensures proper resource cleanup even if the application crashes.
